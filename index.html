        <p>Each of us encounters loss at some point in our lives. Those losses can be big, or small and affect us in different ways. While loss is universal, it affects each of us differently and it is common to feel alone in our experiences.</p>

        <div class="col-space col col-text-smallwidth">
          <p>Through my capstone project, I wanted to develop one possible solution for dealing with the challenging feelings brought up by loss.

          <h2>Initial Questions and Thoughts</h2>

          <p>How do we deal with difficult emotions? There is no right way to process loss, but research supports using creativity as a tool for expression and mindfulness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="align-flexstart">
          <div class="col-halfspace col col-text-smallwidth">
            <p>Creativity comes in many forms, giving individuals the opportunity to find creative outlets that are enjoyable and meaningful to them. Through difficult times in my own life, I have used poetry, collage, illustration, and crafting for comfort, expression, and mindfulness practice.</p>

          <p>Since I found creativity  helpful as a way to handle  challenges in my own life, I thought it might be a good approach in helping others deal with grief or loss in their own lives by creating art about their own difficult experiences</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-halfspace col col-text-smallwidth">
          <p>For a long time I was intimidated to create things&mdash;I didn't see myself as an artist. It was important to me to encourage people who might not feel comfortable with their own creativity to think of artistic practice as a tool for approaching challenging emotions&mdash;to value the process and not the result.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
          <h3>The Museum of Lost Experiences (theMoLE) is a digital collection of creative works about lost experiences,  missed opportunities, and deferred dreams. Anyone can submit their experience to the collection.</h3>

          <p>The goal of theMoLE is to encourage people to use creativity to help them approach uncomfortable emotions and provide a community space for people to share and connect around those feelings. Participants have an opportunity to submit their lost experience to the collection where it will live alongside others' experiences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-nospace col-text-smallwidth">
          <p>What we miss says a lot about what we care about and stepping into someone else’s experience is an intimate encounter with what is important to them. By encouraging viewers to engage with others’ stories of loss, the Museum of Lost Experiences helps reinforce that none of us are alone in experiencing challenges in life.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h4>Branding & Identity Design</h4>
        <p>The brand exploration process began with ideation around the project title. I used wordmapping to expand the project name into a web of interrelated words to spark ideas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-nospace col col-text">
        <h5>Moodboard</h5>
        <p>A moodboard helped me bring together visual ideas for the brand. The idea of people’s disparate experiences coming together in this project inspired me to bring collage aesthetic into the moodboard. The muted, cheerful colors are intended to invoke nostalgia. I also wanted to use some aspects of institutional “museum” aesthetic to give the brand some austerity and sophistication.</p>

        <h4>Web Design</h4>
        <p>After establishing the beginnings of the brand identity, it was easy to elaborate the shapes used in the logomark and the typography into a design system I could use to make mockups for the website.</p>

          <p>The Museum of Lost Experiences is centered around collecting creative submissions from users, so I knew I needed a way to store the submissions and dynamically access them in order to display the collection on the site.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h4>Initial Surveying</h4>
          <p>To gain insight into how to design the submission process, I created a 20-question survey using Google Forms. Using my network and asking friends/family to circulate the survey, I had 85 participants.</p>
        </div>

          <div>
            <p>One takeaway from the survey, was to refocus my attention on two different user groups:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>people likely to submit projects</li>
              <li>viewers of experiences on the website</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is an overlap between groups—based on responses, but I believe that there are some users who are not likely to submit themselves, but would be interested in seeing others’ experiences. Hopefully, through its public collection, theMoLE can still be a place for communal grief processing.</p>

          <h4>User Research</h4>
          <p>After programming the majority of the website, I tested its key functionality with three users from my two user groups, viewers of the collection, and submitters to the collection. I improved the site after each user test to incorporate their feedback. The testing resulted in a more clear submission experience and a more efficient site flow for users looking to learn about submitting and submit their experiences.</p>
