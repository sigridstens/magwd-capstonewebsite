        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>This project was initially inspired by the changes and losses we’ve all experienced due to the pandemic. Now more than ever many of us are dealing with difficult feelings, as we face a seismic shift in our daily lives due to Covid-19.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-nospace col">
        <p>Whether our pain comes from a change in routine, the death of someone dear, or missing an opportunity; acknowledging that loss and expressing it can help us move through our feelings—experiencing and releasing them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-space col">
        <p>Through my capstone project, I wanted to develop one possible solution for dealing with the challenging feelings brought up by loss. I began the project researching related topics like grief, and different, and the use of creativity, nostalgia, and mindfulness as tools for handling difficult emotions.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts Toward a Solution</h2>
        <p>How do we deal with difficult emotions? There is no right way to process loss, but research supports using creativity as a tool for expression and mindfulness.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-nospace col">
        <p>Art therapy is a recognized form of therapy that utilizes “active art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship.” But you don’t need to attend therapy to take advantage of the benefits of mindful creative practice.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-space col">
        <p>Creativity comes in many forms, giving individuals the opportunity to find creative outlets that are enjoyable and meaningful to them. Through difficult times in my own life, I have used poetry, collage, and crafting for comfort, expression, and mindfulness practice.</p>

        <p>The Museum of Lost Experiences aims to be a platform for people to connect around losses big and small and use creativity to process uncomfortable emotions. The project will give people an opportunity to process grief by creating a creative representation of a lost experience to submit to the collection where it will live alongside others’ experiences.</p>
