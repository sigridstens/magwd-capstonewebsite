      <p>We have all felt loss or grief at some point in our lives. While grief is universal, it affects each of us differently and it is common to feel like we are alone in our experiences.</p>

      <p>The Museum of Lost Experiences, a crowd-sourced collection of artistic representations about grief, aims to be a platform for people to connect around losses big and small and process our experiences creatively in a community space.</p>

      <p>The Coronavirus pandemic has caused a seismic shift in our daily lives and we are all grieving our loss of experiences. While loss is universal, it affects each of us differently and it is common to feel alone in our experiences. The Museum of Lost Experiences—a crowd-sourced collection of artistic representations about things we miss—aims to be a platform for people to connect around losses big and small and use creativity to process uncomfortable emotions.</p>

      <p>Whether our pain comes from a change in routines, the death of someone close, or missing out on an opportunity; acknowledging that loss and expressing it can help us move through our feelings—experiencing and releasing them. The project will give people an opportunity to process grief by creating an artistic representation of their loss to submit it to the collection where it will live alongside others’ stories.</p>

      <p>What we miss says a lot about what we care about and stepping into someone else’s experience is an intimate encounter with what is important to them.  The Museum of Lost Experiences encourages viewers to engage with others’ stories of loss in order to reinforce that we are not alone in experiencing challenges in life. The project reimagines what a museum looks like by allowing submissions to be explored on the website, or checked out to view at home.</p>
